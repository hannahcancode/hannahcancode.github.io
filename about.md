I'm a relatively new Sydneysider and developer (currently focussing on JavaScript/React). You can often find me at Women Who Code, Girl Geek Dinners/Meetups, SydJS, React Sydney etc. etc. I'm also a bit addicted to giving tech presentations, so you may have seen me speak at one of these, or at Linux Conf Australia, or /dev/world. You can see more talks I've done on my [talk page](/talks)

Outside of coding I love eating brunch, travelling, drinking coffee and patting dogs. I'm loving Sydney life and exploring the big city. On the side I also dabble in podcasting and am a beginner arduino and robot enthusist.

I'm documenting my journey here and at {% include icon-twitter.html username="hannahcancode" %}.
