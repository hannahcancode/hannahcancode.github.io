I'm a new Sydneysider, on the path to being a junior developer and an active member of the Sydney tech community. You can often find me at Women Who Code, Girl Geek Dinners/Meetups and Pyladies.

Outside of coding I love eating brunch, travelling, drinking coffee and patting dogs. I'm loving Sydney life and exploring the big city. On the side I also dabble in podcasting and am a beginner arduino and robot enthusistic. 

I'm documenting my journey here and at {% include icon-twitter.html username="hannahcancode" %}.
