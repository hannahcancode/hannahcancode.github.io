In January I went to Linux Conference Australia (LCA), which is a conference focussing on free and open source software (FOSS) and the community involved in creating it. LCA is a week long conference, which starts with two days of miniconfs - these are generally centered around a topic like law, community or games and its intersection with FOSS.

I went to present at WOOTConf (Women of Open Technology), which was a miniconference curated by the creators of KatieConf, aiming to showcase people in tech who identify as women. The talks weren't related to being a woman in tech, rather they just want to increase the number of women speakers at tech events.

I plan to write a blog later about my talk itself, so I thought I'd give a rundown on some of the talks I enjoyed. I have to say these mostly come from WOOTConf, and I applaud the organisers on putting together such an interesting and diverse lineup.

Aurynn Shaw opened WOOTConf with Human-Driven Development, talking about why toxic team members shouldn't be retained purely because of their skill or knowledge. She talked about how their knowledge had effectively already been lost if their colleagues couldn't successfully interact with them. I highly recommend either [watching her talk][aurynn-talk] or reading [the article][aurynn-article].
