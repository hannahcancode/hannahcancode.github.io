title:  "2017: Another Year in Code Review"
---

2017 was a year, that's for sure. But it was also a pretty amazing year for me, so I thought I'd share it. I wrote a similar blog post last year to summarise my first year of really digging in to learn to code, but this year I jumped so far ahead.

**January** was a huge month for me so it gets three paragraphs to itself. At the very end of 2016 I applied for a job at a big tech consultancy in Sydney. 3 days into the new year I received an email with an offer of a phone interview. The job sounded amazing and I was so keen. I did the phone interview on my lunch break at work, and they sent me a code challenge to complete. So I took my shiny new python skills and sat down over the weekend and figured out a solution to the challange. Except being self taught, I didn't write a good README. And I had to learn testing in python on the fly. And my code was a bit messy. And I didn't make it through to the next round. And I was *devestated*. But my devestation just cemented my desire to get good and get a job.

Luckily, before I got my rejection, six days into the new year I did something on a whim that changed my life significantly. I sent in my application for the Women in Tech scholarhip to study [Coder Factory Academy](https://coderacademy.edu.au/). I started dipping into my flextime at work, and did a couple of interviews for the course and scholarship. I was told it was very competitive and to not get my hopes up. With my earlier rejection fresh in my mind I did just that, and assumed I wouldn't get it.

Meanwhile, I had been selected to talk at the [WOOTConf](https://2017.katieconf.xyz/) miniconf as part on [Linux Conf Au](https://lca2017.linux.org.au/), and I presented my talk [Hannah Gets Go-ing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9U6YwJupfA&t=). This was my first ever conference talk, and it was pretty exciting to share my attempt at learning Go through a way that actually didn't really work for me, though I did learn a lot along the way (I'm a firm believer in sharing failures as well as successes). During LCA, I received a call from Coder Factory, offering me their scholarhip, which I accepted and changed my life!

**February** was the end of my previous career and the start of Coder Factory. I've written enough about Coder Factory in [other blog posts](https://hannahcancode.github.io/), but in short, **February through to June** was study time. It was intense and I learnt a lot about making my code readable, planning, design, documentation and source control, as well as having the time to really dive into Ruby and Javascript. Making a bunch of Ruby on Rails, Node, React and React Native apps gave me a good basis for doing actual work.

At the end of **June** I started a month long internship with Eventhub. I got to dabble in functional programming in React with Rambda, GraphQL and start up life in general. I also had a meeting with the amazing Fiona from [Lookahead Search](https://www.lookahead.com.au/), who helped me shine up my CV and set me up with some potential employers.

In **July** I continued my internshp, and started interviewing for potential junior roles. Sooner than I knew I'd been offered a role with Scentre Group, and I accepted. I even had fun at the technical interview, which I think is pretty rare, so I took that as a good sign!

**August** was the start of my new job. I could finally say I was a developer and I get to enjoy going into work every day with smart people in a really amazing team.

In **September** I got to focus on speaking, presenting a talk on [React Native](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTP63jQuM9o) to the iOS devs at [/dev/world](http://www.devworld.com.au/), and getting to polish my skills with the YOW Women in Tech speaker training workshop with Damien Conway.

**October** was just work work work (and fancy dinners, high tea and halloween fun).

**November** saw me remaking my [React Native](https://hannahcancode.github.io/assets/talks/sydjsnovember.pdf) talk for a bunch of JavaScript developers at [SydJS](https://www.sydjs.com/).

Feeling pretty settled in my current job, come **December** I started to listen to my aspirations of learning some Computer Science fundamentals, which is what I plan to focus on in the new year. [CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x), [basecs](https://medium.com/basecs) and [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/structure-and-interpretation-computer-programs) will form the beginning of my learning. Bring it on.
